# How to contribute
Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. You are welcome to make changes to the project, and merge it in here. Please keep in mind though that I am currently busy with other projects, so my turnaround time for review might be a few weeks.

## Getting started

### Check out the design

Please checkout the README.md file. It contains the details of the project, and its design. Please feel free to go ahead and add any features, or fix any bugs!

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is your first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.

And that's it! Read the code available and make any changes! Your change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

If you are adding new functionality, start from the branch **master**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request to me. Like I mentioned earlier, my turnaroud time might be a few weeks.

### Tests

You can find a few unit tests for this project. If you're adding any new functionality, please add relevant unit tests as well.

### Documentation

Please add detailed comments to your code. If you are adding new features, please update the documentation to reflect that in the README.md file.
